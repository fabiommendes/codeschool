Coding IO questions
===================

Coding IO questions represent the standard online judge question type: users
submit a program that should solve some challenge and the answer is judged only
analysing the inputs and outputs passed to such a program. This question type
is very useful because challenges are become language agnostic. It is however
very difficult to analyse some other aspects such as code quality, architecture,
code style, etc.
